## Assignment 3

Garrett, great work digging into the Mathieu equations. It's clear that there's a lot of physics in MS and you have done a good job of summarizing your readings and where you understanding is. A task for you this week is to bring together these readings into a coherent background discussion. That is, you will need to start drawing across the readings and, perhaps, dig a little more into the nuclear physics side of things to present what it seems like you want to present: how does MS work in nuclear physics experiments. I'll be looking in your synthesis for how you are bringing these papers together and what you think is still missing to create a full paper. Again great work on this!

* Score: 20/20

## Assignment 2

Garrett, I think reading this article first was a good idea. You have a lot to work with given the background here and you will need to decide where you want to take this. A historical discussion of the development of MS is fine as would be talking about cutting edge work on MS. Or loking at a specific set of results and discussing them in context. Either way you have a good foundation here. In reading the summary, I wondered why the motion of particles is governed by the Mathieu equations -- like how does that come about physically. If you choose to use this model to illustrate MS then anything you do going forward should include a discussion of how this mathematical model comes about. Next week, I'll be looking for you to narrow your focus on a specific aspects that you want to present in your paper (one of the above that I mentioned or something all together different). Great work so far.

## Assignment 1

Garrett, the topic of mass spectrometry is very rich, so you will need to decide what to focus your efforts on as it can easily get unwieldy. I think you have done a great thing by focusing on review articles in your proposed list of papers. These can offer a great introduction to the field and what is important and also help you decide what to focus on. But these papers are LONG, so I think it would be reasonable for you to summarize one of them for Friday. Great work and I'm looking forward to seeing what you decide to focus on.

* Score 20/20
