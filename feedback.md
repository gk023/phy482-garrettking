## Assignment 2



## Assignment 1

Garrett, the topic of mass spectrometry is very rich, so you will need to decide what to focus your efforts on as it can easily get unwieldy. I think you have done a great thing by focusing on review articles in your proposed list of papers. These can offer a great introduction to the field and what is important and also help you decide what to focus on. But these papers are LONG, so I tihnk it would be reasonable for you to sumamrize one of them for Friday. Great work and I'm looking forward to seeing what you decide to focus on.
